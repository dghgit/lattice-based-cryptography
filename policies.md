description: How do we choose our resources?
---

## Welcome to the lattice club!

Thank you for visiting us!

We strive to create a community that is interested in lattice-based cryptography but
that is also respectful with each other! Due to this, we follow in our events,
repo and website the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

### What kind of resources do we include in the website?

We strive to provide resources that:

* Have the explicit permission from the authors of thesis to be posted here.
* Cover specific topics: rather than providing all resources covering a topic, we
  try to provide one that seems to balance them all.
* Emphasise diversity: we will prioritise including resources which authors are
  from under-represented communities.
